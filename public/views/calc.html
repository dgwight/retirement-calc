                    <h3>${{ results.optionB.annualPension }} Annualy</h3>
                    <p>Option B provides a lifetime allowance to you that is approximately 1% to
                        5% less per month than Option A.* The annuity portion of your allowance
                        is reduced to allow a benefit for your beneficiary. Upon your death, your
                        surviving beneficiary of record, or if there is no beneficiary living, the person
                        or persons appearing in the judgment of the State Retirement Board to be

                    <p>During your retirement, the balance in your annuity savings account de-
                        creases by an amount equal to the annuity portion of your pension. In most
                        cases, your annuity savings account will be depleted after 15 years. Upon your
                        death, the balance remaining in your account will be paid in a lump sum to
                        your beneficiary or your estate. If your annuity savings account is depleted
                        while you are receiving your allowance, you will continue to receive your full
                        Option B pension for life; but your beneficiary will not receive any payment

                        with a lifetime allowance approximately 7-15% less than that which you would
                        receive under Option A. However, this reduction could be greater depending
                        on the age difference between you and your beneficiary. Upon your death, your
                        designated beneficiary will be paid a monthly allowance for the remainder of
                        his or her life. The survivor benefit will be equal to two-thirds of the allowance
                        that was being paid to you at the time of your death.</p>
                    <p>Your monthly allowance received under Option C depends upon life expectancy

                        the nearest birthday of the retiree and the beneficiary. For example: for a retiring
                        member who is 58 years and 8 months old, and beneficiary who is 57 years
                        and 2 months old, the factor used would be age 59 for the retiring member and
                        age 57 for the beneficiary.</p>
                    <p>Special circumstances concerning Option C: If you choose Option C and your
                        beneficiary predeceases you, you cannot name a different Option C beneficiary.
                        However, your monthly benefit will “pop up” to the Option A benefit amount
                        that you would have received on the date of your retirement, plus any cost-of-
                        living adjustments. The new, higher amount is then paid to you as of the date
                        of the death of your beneficiary and until you die.</p>
