        <h2>Option A - No Survivor Benefit</h2>
        <h3>${{ results.optionA.annualPension }} Annualy</h3>
        <p>Option A will provide you with your full retirement allowance in monthly
            payments as long as you live. However, all allowance payments stop when
            you die and no benefits are provided to survivors.</p>

        <h2>Option B - Protects Your Annuity</h2>
        <h3>${{ results.optionB.annualPension }} Annualy</h3>
        <p>Option B provides a lifetime allowance to you that is approximately 1% to
            5% less per month than Option A.* The annuity portion of your allowance
            is reduced to allow a benefit for your beneficiary. Upon your death, your
            surviving beneficiary of record, or if there is no beneficiary living, the person
            or persons appearing in the judgment of the State Retirement Board to be
            entitled, will be paid the remaining balance of your accumulated total deduc-
            tions from your annuity reserve account.</p>

        <h2>Option C - Joint Survivor Allowance</h2>
        <h3>${{ results.optionC.annualPension }} Annualy</h3>
        <p>Option C, also known as the joint and last survivor allowance, provides you
            with a lifetime allowance approximately 7-15% less than that which you would
            receive under Option A. However, this reduction could be greater depending
            on the age difference between you and your beneficiary. Upon your death, your
            designated beneficiary will be paid a monthly allowance for the remainder of
            his or her life. </p>
